All Cogent3 Python scripts, input files, and output files used to and resulting from calculations for amino acid 
frequency vector inference of the 31 Primatomorpha and Glires species. 

Steps (for general case of amino acid frequency inference)

1. Generate, locate, or prune desired tree in Newick format

2. Create or locate a concatenated alignment file of genes for the species within the tree file in fasta format

3. Generate or locate a time reversible amino acid exchangeability matrix

3. Write and run Python Script using the Cogent3 library

    Substeps:

    1. Import relevant Cogent3 libraries
    
    2. Import the tree, matrix, and alignment files

    3. Create substitution model with matrix file

    4. Designate relevant branch groupings (clades)

    5. Set optimization settings

    6. Create likelihood function with the substitution model, tree, and alignment files

    7. Infer amino acid frequency vectors with the likelihood function and optimization settings

    8. Print relevant results
