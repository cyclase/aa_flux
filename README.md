# Overview

This Github contains all files needed to re-run the analyses in McShea et al., "The effectiveness of selection in a species affects the direction of amino acid frequency evolution"


ParsimonyAnalysis contains the files and scripts needed to get the set of parsimonious substitutions on the mouse, rat, human, and chimp lineages.

Parsimony_flux contains the files and scripts necessary to calculate flux from the parsimonious substitutions, as well as tables containing flux values.

ML_flux contains the files and scripts necessary to calculate flux by fitting a non-stationary model of amino acid evolution, as well as tables containing flux values.

CAIS contains the files and scripts necessary to calculate CAIS slopes, as well as tables containing those slopes.

Figures contains the script to create the paper figures, as well as sundry calculations.
